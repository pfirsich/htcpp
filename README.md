# htcpp

A HTTP/1.1 server using [io_uring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Io_uring) built with C++17. It's single-threaded and all network IO and inotify usage is asynchronous.

Currently it has the following features:
* The `htcpp` executable is a file server that serves a specified directory (or multiple)
* Can also be used as a library with a [Router](src/router.hpp) like many popular web frameworks (see example in [libexample.cpp](src/libexample.cpp))
* Host multiple sites on different ports or for different `Host` headers
* Persistent Connections (it doesn't support pipelining though, because no one does)
* Caches files and watches them using inotify to reload them automatically if they change on disk
* TLS with automatic reloading of certificate chain or private key if they change on disk
* A built-in ACME client and semi-automatic (some configuration required) HTTPS via [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org), like [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com)
* Built-in [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)-compatible metrics using [cpprom](https://github.com/pfirsich/cpprom/)
* The only dependency that is not another project of mine is OpenSSL (of course exclusing the Linux Kernel, glibc and the standard library).
* [JOML](https://github.com/pfirsich/joml) configuration files ([examples](./configs))
* `ETag` and `Last-Modified` headers and support for `If-None-Match` and `If-Modified-Since`
* Header Editing Rules ([header-editing.joml](./configs/header-editing.joml))
* IP rate limiting and limiting the number of concurrent connections ([limits.joml](./configs/limits.joml))

It requires io_uring features that are available since kernel 5.11, so it will exit immediately on earlier kernels.

Also if submission queue polling (config: `io_submission_queue_polling` (boolean)) is enabled, which it is by default, htcpp needs to run as root or it needs the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability.

## Building
Install [meson](https://mesonbuild.com/).

Execute the following commands:
```shell
meson setup build/
meson compile -C build
```

If OpenSSL can be found during the build, TLS support is automatically enabled. The build will fail for OpenSSL versions earlier than `1.1.1`.

## Docker
Alternatively you can build a Docker container:
```shell
meson subprojects download # initial build
meson subprojects update # subsequent builds
docker build --tag htcpp .
```
Adjust the tag to whatever you prefer.

Then run it like this:
```
docker run --init --network=host htcpp <args>
```
The `--init` is necessary for the container to terminate gracefully. You can replace `--network=host` with an explicit port forwarding, but host networking gives better performance.

If you wish to use the ACME client, make sure to install root certificates in your image to allow HTTPS requests to the ACME directory (e.g. Let's Encrypt). On Ubuntu for example the corresponding package is called `ca-certificates`.

## To Do (Must)
* Finish todos in [aiopp](https://github.com/pfirsich/aiopp) and then remove stuff from this repository and use aiopp instead.

## To Do (Should)
* Try to implement as much as possible described in this document: https://github.com/axboe/liburing/wiki/io_uring-and-networking-in-2023. I need to wait a while for most of it to arrive in my distro kernel.
* Improve behaviour in case of DDos (esp. in conjunction with Cloudflare DDoS protection) - from here: https://fasterthanli.me/articles/i-won-free-load-testing (great post!)
    - Only parse request line to determine if a handler exists then respond 404/405 and close as soon as possible (avoid big bogus POSTs eating up bandwidth).
* TLS SNI (then move `tls` object into `hosts`)
* Currently the response body is copied from the response object (argument to respond) to the responseBuffer before sending. Somehow avoid this copy. (send header and body separately?).
* Split off the library part better, so htcpp can actually be used as a library cleanly
* If no metrics are defined, do not pay for it at all (no .labels(), not counting - mock it?)
* URL percent decoding (since I only save Url::path and saving a decoded path component in there would simply make it incorrect, it is the router that has to be percent-encoding aware)
* Directory Listings
* Optionally use MD5/SHA1 for ETag
* Add some tests ðŸ˜¬ (maybe have a Python script run the server with certain configs and test responses)
* Test with certbot: Now that I have reloading of certificates and I can configure multiple sites (to host `.well-known/acme-challenge` on port 80), I think I have everything that I need.

## To Do (Could)
* Large file transfer (with `sendfile` or `slice`)
    - Partial Content ([Range](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Range))
* Reverse proxy mode
    - Load-Balancing
    - Maybe pull load-balancing too! (see discussion here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35588797)
* IPv6
* Use coroutines instead of callbacks!
* Customizable access log: Have the option to include some request headers, like Referer or User-Agent
* LuaJIT for scripting dynamic websites
* Request pool/arena allocator (only allocate a big buffer once per request and use it as the backing memory for an arena allocator)
* Signal handling so it works better in Docker (just use `--init` for now)
* Make file reading asynchronous (there are a bunch of problem with this though)
* Include hosts from other files
* Configure MIME Types in config

## Won't Do (for now?)
* Compression: Afaik you are supposed to disable it for images and other already compressed assets (obviously), but since I only plan to serve small HTML pages with this, there is not much use.
* Support for kTLS: It's probably a good performance improvement, but quite involved and I don't need it.
* Dispatch HTTP sessions to a thread pool (to increase TLS performance): I will likely only deploy this on very small single vCPU VMs. Note for the future: have a ring per thread and `accept` on the same listening socket on all threads.
* chroot "jail": According to the man page you should not use these for security, so if you want filesystem isolation, use Docker
* Dropping privileges: Not hard to do, but the same applies. If you want to deploy it securely, use Docker.
